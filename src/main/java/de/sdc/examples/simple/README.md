This is a simple example of how to use this framework.

How to start:
You have to execute the ServerStart first and then any number of ClientStart.

What will be done?
This will calculate the square for the numbers 0 to 10 with the clients that 
are connected to the server five times.
Each of the clients sleeps 1 second for each number it calculates to simulate 
calculations that need much time for execution.
The results are printed.
